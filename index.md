# How to check if a story or a fact is true?

There are many news, information and stories flying around on the internet. Some are true, some are not and some are in the middle - not totally wrong and not totally correct.

With this easy steps you can identify false information and avoid to make certain mistakes if you write an article yourself. 

## Step 1: Look at the time stamp

When was the information or an article published? 
When and where was a statement made? 
Are there several independent primary sources providing the same information at this time?

## Step 2: Is there consistency?

Is the story logical and content consistent throughout the article?
Does the headline fit to the story? 
Are there any correction? Has the story been modified since first publication?

## Step 3: Is the source itself trustworthy? 

Is the media outlet known to be serious? (Is it a satirical journal or is the outlet known for fake news?)
Does an article fit to the authors previous style of writing? What else has she/he published? Might he be biased?
Who is the primary source (references): Is the person an eyewitness, expert, politician, scholar, etc.? Was the information published by an institution, like the government, a NGO, IO or a company? 
What is the motivation to publish something? Who is behind the person/organization? Who gives the money? 

## Step 4: Methods used by the source

Is it clear how the author got the information?
Are there any kinds of data used? How were the information collected?

How has the information been processed?
What kind of limitations could be there?

After the verification of sources there are still traps that could make you to appear not trustworthy.
