Is the story logical and content consistent throughout the article?
Has the story been modified since first publication?
Does the headline fit to the story? (Just curious, is there tools that people can suggest headline for articles? Like crowdsource headline? Re: like that: http://www.contentrow.com/tools/link-bait-title-generator :)
Does it fit to the authors previous style of writing? What else has he published?
